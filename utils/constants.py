L-SYSTEM SYMBOL DEFINITIONS

Variables:
    A: Apex/bud, a point where new growth can occur.
    F: Forward, drawing a branch segment.
    S: A longer branch segment.
    L: A leaf structure.
    f: Forward, but without drawing. Used for positioning.

Constants (delta = __ degrees):
    [: Push the current state (position, orientation) onto the stack.
    ]: Pop the state from the stack.
    +: Turn Left (Yaw). By an angle delta.
    -: Turn Right (Yaw). By angle delta.
    &: Pitch Down. By angle delta.
    ^: Pitch Up. By angle delta.
    \\: Roll Left. By angle delta.
    /: Roll Right. By angle delta.
    |: Turn around (180 degree rotation).
